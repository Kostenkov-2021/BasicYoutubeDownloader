## Downloading a Video

If there is a video link in your clipboard, you will first be greeted with a dialog box where you can choose the folder to save the video. Then you will be directed to a dialog where you can choose the quality. Once you make your selection, your video will start downloading, and the progress will be automatically narrated. If you want to hear the progress, you can press the `NVDA+<` shortcut key defined during the download. This shortcut key will be removed once the download is complete.

## Downloading a Playlist

Then you will be directed to a dialog where you can choose the quality. Once you make your selection, the videos in the playlist will start downloading to a subfolder named after the playlist inside the chosen folder, and the progress will be automatically narrated.
